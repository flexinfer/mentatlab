## 🔍 Distributed Tracing System

### OpenTelemetry-Powered Visibility
- **End-to-end tracing** across all agents and services
- **Cross-runtime correlation** between WASM and container agents
- **Automatic context propagation** through entire execution flows
- **Visual trace timeline** showing critical paths and dependencies

### Key Features
```yaml
Trace Capabilities:
  - Trace ID correlation across 10,000+ concurrent agents
  - Sub-millisecond span recording
  - Adaptive sampling (1-100% based on errors)
  - 30-day trace retention with cold storage

Critical Path Analysis:
  - Automatic bottleneck identification
  - Dependency visualization
  - Performance regression detection
  - Resource usage attribution
```

### Developer Experience
```python
# Zero-config tracing in agent SDK
@traced
async def process(self, input):
    # Automatic span creation and propagation
    result = await self.model.predict(input)
    return result
```
