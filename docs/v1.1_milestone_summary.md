mentatctl agent search       # Search marketplace
mentatctl agent install      # Install with dependencies

mentatctl dev run           # Hot-reload development
mentatctl dev debug         # Interactive debugging
mentatctl dev profile       # Performance analysis
mentatctl dev shell         # REPL for agents

mentatctl registry list     # Local agent cache
mentatctl registry sync     # Update from marketplace
```

### Developer Experience Improvements
