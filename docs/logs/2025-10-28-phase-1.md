# Work Log â€” Phase 1 (UI + CogPaks)

Date: 2025-10-28

Summary
- Fixed remote CogPak UI loading by resolving relative `remoteEntry` against the Gateway base URL.
- Ensured `/agents/*` paths work in dev and prod via proxying to Orchestrator.

Changes
- Frontend
  - Updated `MissionControlLayout.tsx` to construct remote UI URL using `getGatewayBaseUrl()` when `remoteEntry` is relative.
  - Added Vite proxy for `/agents` to Orchestrator in `vite.config.js`.
- Gateway
  - Added `GET /agents/{path}` that proxies to Orchestrator static mount.
- Docs
  - Added Phase 1 plan and checklist.

Validation Notes
- In dev, `/agents/ctm-cogpack/ui/remoteEntry.js` now loads via Vite proxy (targeting the Orchestrator).
- In prod/preview, frontend origin hits Gateway `/agents/*`, which forwards to Orchestrator.

Next Steps (Phase 2)
- Remove deprecated UI surfaces and update documentation accordingly.
- Consolidate remote UI loader logic and add basic tests.
