# Work Log â€” Phase 2 (Deprecated UI removal and wiring)

Date: 2025-10-28

Summary
- Removed legacy FlowBuilder route and deprecated components (AgentPalette, FlowCanvas, CommandPalette, PropertyInspector).
- Replaced the Mission Control Inspector with a lightweight `InspectorPanel` that shows run and graph selection info.
- Consolidated remote UI resolution/dispatch into `src/utils/remoteUi.ts` and updated Mission Control to use it.
- Removed legacy helpers (`loadFlow.ts`, `services/websocketService.ts`); updated `IssuesPanel` to lint a provided flow or an empty default.
- Updated tests to mock `StreamingCanvas` and `InspectorPanel` instead of removed components.
- Updated README to reflect removal of legacy UI and StreamingCanvas usage.

Changed Files (high level)
- Added: `src/utils/remoteUi.ts`, `components/mission-control/panels/InspectorPanel.tsx`
- Updated: `components/mission-control/layout/MissionControlLayout.tsx`, `components/mission-control/panels/IssuesPanel.tsx`, `App.tsx`, README
- Tests: updated `StatusBar.spec.tsx`; removed `PropertyInspector.test.tsx`
- Deleted: AgentPalette.tsx, FlowCanvas.tsx, CommandPalette.tsx, PropertyInspector.tsx, loadFlow.ts, services/websocketService.ts

Validation
- Frontend build passes (`npm run build`).
- Mission Control renders and mounts StreamingCanvas; Inspector shows run/selection stats.
- CogPak remote UIs still open via the shared helper (`openCogpakUi`).

Notes
- Graph selection is bridged to Inspector via window events (`graphNodeSelected`/`graphNodeCleared`).
- Further doc cleanup of deep references remains in Phase 3.
