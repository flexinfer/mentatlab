# mentatlab
MentatLab is mission control for composable AI—design, launch and monitor intelligent agents with the discipline of a scientist and the intuition of a Mentat.

The documents below spell out the composable‑frontend contract: how multiple agents, chat panels and runtime tasks are wired together on the canvas, stored in Git, and executed by the backend.  It is tightly cross‑referenced to the Product Vision, Architecture and Road‑map sections you provided, so contributors can see exactly where the “glue” lives.

	•	agents.md → how to create a single Lego brick (a Cog‑Pak).
	•	flows.md (below) → how to snap many bricks together into a live, observable workspace.
