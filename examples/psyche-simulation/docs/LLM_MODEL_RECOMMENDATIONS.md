# LLM Model Recommendations for AMD 7900xtx 24GB GPU

## Summary of Findings

Based on extensive research using Tavily search, here are the top recommendations for running LLMs on your AMD Radeon RX 7900xtx 24GB GPU.

## Top Model Recommendations

### 1. **DeepSeek R1 (7B/8B versions)**
- **Why**: Latest reasoning model with excellent performance
- **Quantization**: Q4_K_M or Q5_K_M recommended
- **VRAM Usage**: ~4-6GB for Q4, ~5-8GB for Q5
- **Notes**: Distilled versions (deepseek-r1-distill-llama-8b) are particularly efficient

### 2. **Llama 3.1 (8B version)**
- **Why**: State-of-the-art performance, well-supported
- **Quantization**: Q4_K_M or Q5_K_S
- **VRAM Usage**: ~5-7GB
- **Notes**: Excellent for general purpose tasks

### 3. **Qwen2.5 (32B version)**
- **Why**: Can fit in 24GB with Q4 quantization
- **Quantization**: Q4_K_M
- **VRAM Usage**: ~18-22GB
- **Notes**: Larger model for better quality when VRAM allows

### 4. **Mistral Nemo (12B)**
- **Why**: Good balance of size and performance
- **Quantization**: Q5_K_M or Q6_K
- **VRAM Usage**: ~8-10GB
- **Notes**: Excellent for coding and reasoning tasks

## GPU Performance Notes

- The RX 7900 XTX has 24GB GDDR6 memory with 960 GB/s bandwidth
- Performance in rasterization is competitive with RTX 4080
- Ray tracing performance lags behind NVIDIA
- For LLM inference, the large VRAM is the key advantage

## Quantization Guidelines

- **Q4_K_M**: Best balance of quality and size (recommended for most users)
- **Q5_K_S/Q5_K_M**: Higher quality, moderate size increase
- **Q6_K**: Near full precision quality, larger size
- **Q8_0**: Minimal quality loss, requires more VRAM

## Next Steps

1. **Pull model to Ollama pod**:
   ```bash
   ollama pull deepseek-r1:8b-llama-q4_K_M
   # or
   ollama pull llama3.1:8b-instruct-q4_K_M
   ```

2. **Update LiteLLM configuration** to use the new model

3. **Test performance** with your specific workloads

## Additional Tools Mentioned

- **Ollama**: Command-line tool for running models
- **LM Studio**: GUI-based tool with model compatibility checking
- **Jan**: Open-source ChatGPT alternative
- **Llamafile**: Single executable approach
- **GPT4ALL**: Privacy-focused local LLM tool

## Performance Optimization Tips

1. Use models with 128k context windows for long-form tasks
2. Consider running multiple smaller models vs one large model
3. Monitor VRAM usage to avoid swapping
4. Use streaming for real-time responses
5. Enable GPU acceleration in your chosen tool
