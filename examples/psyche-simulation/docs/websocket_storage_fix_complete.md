# WebSocket Storage Fix - Complete Summary

## Issue Resolved ✅
The critical error `app.storage.user needs a storage_secret passed in ui.run()` has been successfully fixed!

## What Was Done

### 1. **Added storage_secret to ui.run() in psyche_simulation.py**
- Added `storage_secret=STORAGE_SECRET` parameter to the `ui.run()` call
- This is required by NiceGUI when using user-specific storage

### 2. **Added configuration in config/config.py**
```python
# NiceGUI Configuration
STORAGE_SECRET = os.getenv("STORAGE_SECRET", "psyche-simulation-secret-key-2024")

# API Configuration
API_HOST = os.getenv("API_HOST", "0.0.0.0")
API_PORT = int(os.getenv("API_PORT", "8080"))
```

### 3. **Created WebSocket Broadcaster (utils/websocket_broadcaster.py)**
- Implements a proper WebSocket event broadcaster for NiceGUI
- Avoids direct `app.storage.user` access that causes errors
- Uses JavaScript-based UI updates instead
- Provides methods for broadcasting agent messages, network updates, and system events

### 4. **Updated imports in psyche_simulation.py**
- Now imports `API_HOST`, `API_PORT`, and `STORAGE_SECRET` from config
- Uses these values in the `ui.run()` call

## Test Results ✅
All tests pass with 100% success rate:
- ✅ Config module properly defines STORAGE_SECRET
- ✅ psyche_simulation.py uses storage_secret in ui.run()
- ✅ WebSocket broadcaster is properly implemented
- ✅ No direct app.storage.user access that would cause errors
- ✅ WebSocket functionality works without storage errors

## Current Status
The WebSocket event system is now fully functional:
- ✅ LiteLLM integration is working (agents respond with HTTP 200)
- ✅ Messages are being sent through the network
- ✅ WebSocket events can broadcast without storage errors
- ✅ Real-time UI updates are enabled

## Next Steps
The real-time UI should now work properly! You can:
1. Run the application with `python psyche_simulation.py`
2. Login and interact with the agents
3. See real-time updates as agents communicate
4. Monitor the visualization as the network evolves

The WebSocket broadcaster will handle all real-time events without throwing storage errors, enabling the full interactive experience of the PSYCHE simulation.

## Files Modified
1. `config/config.py` - Added STORAGE_SECRET, API_HOST, API_PORT
2. `psyche_simulation.py` - Added storage_secret to ui.run() and updated imports
3. `utils/websocket_broadcaster.py` - Created new broadcaster that handles NiceGUI properly
