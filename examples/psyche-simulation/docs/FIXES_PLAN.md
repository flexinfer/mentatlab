# Persistent Errors Analysis and Fix Plan

## Issues Identified and RESOLVED ✅

### 1. Threading Lock Pickling Error - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: The `_class_lock` attribute causes pickling errors when agents are serialized.
- Location: `utils/llm_wrapper.py` lines 94-99
- The threading.Lock() object cannot be pickled
- Lazy initialization doesn't solve the core issue

**Solution IMPLEMENTED**:
- ✅ Removed the class-level lock entirely
- ✅ Implemented module-level lock (`_module_lock`) instead
- ✅ Moved rate limiting data to module level (`_request_times`, `_max_requests_per_minute`)
- ✅ Made `_enforce_rate_limit()` a static method using module-level lock

### 2. Duplicate Code Blocks - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Multiple duplicate method definitions in `utils/llm_wrapper.py`
- `_get_class_lock()` appears 5+ times
- `_enforce_rate_limit()` appears 5+ times
- `_make_api_request_fallback()` appears 4+ times
- `_call()` appears 3+ times

**Solution IMPLEMENTED**:
- ✅ Removed ALL duplicate method definitions
- ✅ Kept only one clean instance of each method
- ✅ Reduced file from 249 lines with duplicates to 201 clean lines

### 3. Attribute Access Inconsistency - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Mixing `self._api_url` (underscore) with `self.api_url` (no underscore)
- The __init__ method uses `object.__setattr__` to set `_api_url` (with underscore)
- But methods reference `self.api_url` (without underscore)
- This causes AttributeError when methods try to access the attributes

**Solution IMPLEMENTED**:
- ✅ Consistently use underscore-prefixed attributes throughout (`self._api_url`, `self._api_key`, etc.)
- ✅ Updated ALL method references to use the correct attribute names
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with property getters/setters

### 4. Import Issues - VERIFIED ✅
**Problem**: The `utils/__init__.py` might not properly export CustomLLM
- This could cause import errors in agent modules

**Solution IMPLEMENTED**:
- ✅ Verified imports in `utils/__init__.py` are correct
- ✅ Tested imports work properly across all modules

## Implementation Results ✅

### Tests Performed:
1. ✅ `python test_threading_error.py` - PASSED
2. ✅ `python test_all_agents.py` - PASSED (All 5 agents created successfully)
3. ✅ `from psyche_simulation import PsycheSimulation` - PASSED

### Key Improvements Made:
1. **Threading Safety**: Replaced problematic class-level locks with module-level thread-safe implementation
2. **Code Quality**: Eliminated all duplicate code blocks, reducing file size by 20%
3. **Consistency**: Fixed all attribute access inconsistencies
4. **Reliability**: All agent creation and initialization now works without errors
5. **Maintainability**: Clean, organized code structure with proper separation of concerns

### Performance Benefits:
- ✅ No more pickling errors when agents are serialized
- ✅ Consistent attribute access prevents AttributeError exceptions
- ✅ Clean code structure improves maintainability
- ✅ Thread-safe rate limiting works across all CustomLLM instances

## Status: ALL ISSUES RESOLVED ✅

The psyche-simulation repository is now free of the persistent threading, pickling, and attribute access errors that were preventing proper agent initialization and operation.
