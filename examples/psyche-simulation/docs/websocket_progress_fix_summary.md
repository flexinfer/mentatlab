# WebSocket Progress Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The `RealtimeUIUpdater.handle_agent_processing_update` method in `utils/websocket_broadcaster.py` was throwing a `NameError: name 'progress' is not defined` error.

## Root Cause
The error occurred on line 487 where the code attempted to use `{data.get("progress", 0)}` directly within a JavaScript template string inside a Python f-string. Python was trying to evaluate `progress` as a variable in the Python scope, but it didn't exist.

## Solution
The fix involved:

1. **Calculate progress in Python first**:
   ```python
   progress_value = data.get("progress", 0) * 100
   ```

2. **Inject the calculated value into JavaScript**:
   ```python
   const progress = {progress_value};
   ```

3. **Properly escape JavaScript template literals**:
   Changed `${progress}` to `${{progress}}` to avoid conflicts with Python's f-string syntax.

## Verification
The fix was verified to:
- Generate correct JavaScript code with progress values
- Handle various progress values (0%, 25%, 75%, 100%)
- Default to 0 when progress is not provided
- Properly update the UI progress bar gradient

## Result
The streaming UI now works correctly without the "name 'progress' is not defined" error, allowing real-time progress updates during agent processing.
